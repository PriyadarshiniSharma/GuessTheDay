# GuessTheDay
My First Android Quiz App

This app shows a random date and asks the user to guess the day of the week for that date.
Each question has 4 options (days) for the user to choose from.

To play- Just press the "START" button and pick the the correct answer.
Check the score on the "SCORE" counter.
If the correct answer is chosen the background colour of the app changes to green, and it turns red if you choose the wrong answer.
The game will end when an incorrect option is picked and the user will see the final score.

Press "RESTART" to play again! Have fun guessin'!
